FIVE STEPS OF PROBLEM SOLVING

Book Recommendation: "How To Solve It" by George Polya

1. Understanding the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break it Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Refactor

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words? 2. What are the inputs? 3. What are the outputs? 4. Can outputs be determined from inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem? 5. How should I label the important pieces of data?

EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES
Coming up with examples helps you understand the problem better 1. Start with simple examples, then move more complex 2. Examples with empty inputs 3. Examples with invalid inputs

BREAK IT DOWN
Write down the steps
Does not need to be full psudocode

SOLVE/SIMPLIFY
Solve the problem if you can, if you can't, solve a simpler problem

LOOK BACK/REFACTOR
Can you check the result?
Can you derive the result differently?
Can you understand it at a glance?
Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
Can you improve the performance of your solution?
Can you think of other ways to refactor?
How have other people solved this problem?
